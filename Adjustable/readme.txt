Type: Strong (0.004 transparency scale, 0% minimum opacity)

This pack adds distance based transparency to human player models so they don't block your vision and you can see other things going on in the map easier.

Copy the "materials" folder in the pack to "%yoursteamlocation%\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo"
IF YOU WERE NOT PROMPTED TO REPLACE FILES, YOU DID NOT COPY INTO THE RIGHT FOLDER (or you've never played on the server before?)

This does not modify actual game files, so you don't have to worry about a VAC or server ban.
